## 👨🏻‍🔬 Who am I?

As a TechOps professional with a unique background in hospitality, I bring a blend of technical savvy and exceptional people skills to the table. My expertise lies in automating the unconventional (primarily through Okta Workflows ⚙️), creating easy to use or unnoticed processes,  and a keen eye for optimising TechOps to be invisible as much as we can be  🏗️

Currently, I am enjoying life as a **Senior TechOps Engineer** at [Pleo](https://pleo.io/). Here, my primary mission is to identify and refine areas perfect for automation, sprinkling each project with a touch of TechOps magic ✨

In my current role, I ****was **pivotal in revamping the onboarding experience** from a TechOps perspective. This includes crafting engaging videos and comprehensive documentation for new joiners, leading the onboarding presentations, and ensuring every team member is well-versed in our technology without the traditional top-down explaining things 💕

A highlight of my tenure was the **seamless implementation of Okta for unified single sign-on (SSO) across the organisation**. This initiative has successfully integrated over 100 applications, ensuring easy and compliant access management focusing on role-based access control (RBAC).

Here’s the perfect quote to describe my work.

If I have people coming up to me and asking what I actually do, that means I have done it perfectly.

On the other side, if I don’t, the *whole* company will be very aware in minutes. You win some, you lose some I guess.

My profound love for technology is centred around helping individuals maximise device usage and simplifying complex TechOps challenges into digestible, manageable segments. I aim to merge this enthusiasm with the interpersonal skills I've honed to deliver personalised and approachable support. I hold it as my personal mission to make people hate IT/TechOps less. 

I am always excited to tackle new challenges and offer my expertise. If you're facing any tech-related headaches, feel free to [reach out](mailto:hello@zmcsoltai.com) or book me [here](https://calendar.app.google/c3ihmD6LFNpe1LLe7) directly - let's collaborate to find a future-proof solution!
